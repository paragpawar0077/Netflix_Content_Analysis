## Overview

This project analyzes a Netflix dataset to understand content trends, genre distribution, and regional patterns.
The goal is to practice data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python.

## Dataset

Source: Public Netflix dataset

Data includes:
1.Content type (Movie / TV Show)
2.Genre
3.Country
4.Release year
5.Duration
6.The dataset contains missing and inconsistent values, which were handled during preprocessing.

## Tools & Technologies
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

## Workflow

1.Loaded and explored the dataset using Pandas
2.Cleaned data by handling missing values and formatting columns
3.Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
4.Analyzed content distribution by type, genre, and release year
5.Created visualizations to highlight trends and patterns

## Key Insights

Movies dominate the Netflix content library compared to TV shows
Certain genres appear more frequently across regions
A noticeable increase in content releases in recent years
